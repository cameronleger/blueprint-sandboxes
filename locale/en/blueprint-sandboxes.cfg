[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
bpsb-intro-introduction=Welcome to the Blueprint Sandboxes mod!\nThis allows you to use some Editor-mode and God-mode functionality, without leaving your current game, within lab-like environments.\n\nThe best ways to get Blueprints in and out of your Sandboxes are to Copy-and-Paste and utilize your Blueprint Library. Sometimes, you can also "bring" a Blueprint in and out by having it in your cursor.\n\nTo jump into your first Sandbox, use the shortcut __CONTROL__bpsb-toggle-gui-sb-toggle-shortcut__ or click the Toggle Button in your Shortcut Bar. Use the same method again to exit Sandboxes.
bpsb-intro-multiple-sandboxes=A Sandbox GUI appears while you are inside a Sandbox, and the first thing you'll notice is that you can change which Sandbox you are in:\n\nPersonal: this is a Lab-like Sandbox that is unique to you.\nForce: this is another Lab-like Sandbox that is shared between your entire Force.
bpsb-intro-reset-v2=The next thing you might notice in the Sandbox GUI is a Reset Button. The Reset Button will completely reset the current Sandbox that you are in, in case you want to start-over. Be mindful of others when you use this inside of a Force-wide Sandbox!
bpsb-intro-surface-properties=This GUI assists in configuring a specific Sandbox. For example, you can force certain times of the day, or electrify the floor to skip placing power poles.\n\nIf you're playing Space Age or some interesting mods, you might notice that some entities and recipes have surface conditions that must be met, or else they won't build or be selectable. This GUI allows you to choose a preset based on real locations, or customize as needed. Behind the scenes, these presets may contain hidden but important variations in properties, so you'll likely want to choose the closest preset before making any changes!
bpsb-intro-sandbox-force=While you are in a Sandbox environment, you are actually transferred to another Force which strongly resembles your original Force. Since you have more-powerful permissions inside Sandboxes, this allows those to be cleanly separated from your normal activities.\n\nThis also means that you no longer "own" all of the entities in your real world, like trains, platforms, or turrets. Unfortunately, that results in you no longer receiving alerts if they are damaged or destroyed. Plan for this by ensuring your base is well-defended, or check back more frequently so that you don't find a disaster waiting for you.\n\nDepending on your Mod Settings, this Force will either synchronize the Research that you've unlocked, or have all Research unlocked already. For the former, the "progress" of an individual Technology cannot be real-time, but the Research Queue is kept in-sync.\n\nSince this Force is based off of your own Force, if you change Forces then you will have different Force-related Sandboxes, and your Personal Sandbox might require a Reset (since you no longer own anything inside of it).
bpsb-intro-new-recipes-v2=While you are in a Sandbox environment, you also have access to some new Recipes and Tools for easier experimenting.\n\nFirst, Factorio's own hidden Loaders are enabled, if they weren't already enabled by another mod. For the same load-testing purposes, the Infinity Accumulator, Chest, and Pipe are also enabled. You can use these as abstract inputs and outputs to test your designs.\n\nThen, you have an Entity Selection Planner, so with (__CONTROL__select-for-blueprint__), you can spawn those interesting things in the Sandbox; using the alternative selection method (__CONTROL__reverse-select__), you can remove them!\n\nThere's a simpler Tile Selection Planner to change the underlying tiles (or __CONTROL__reverse-select__ them back to lab tiles).\n\nFinally, inside Sandboxes you can craft items immediately and directly to your cursor; instead of crafting to your inventory and then selecting that result, anything you click-to-craft is ready for use! This also replaces what was in your cursor before, so you can simply __CONTROL__open-character-gui__, click a recipe, __CONTROL__confirm-gui__, keep designing, rinse, and repeat. This is also configurable per-user.
bpsb-intro-god-mode=When you initially enter a Sandbox, you will be using the familiar Remote View. Inside these Sandboxes, most of the operations that would be handled by bots are automatically handled (via Lua), so this is usually quite fine. But, Remote Views are somewhat temporary, and you may find yourself wanting to be more integrated with the Sandbox.\n\nIf you "drop inside" the Sandbox, you are treated like a God and have more direct control. Your body stays where you left it (be careful with that!) and you can float freely in here. This God inventory is persistent and separate from your normal player's inventory. This is not always possible, because it needs to detach you from your body, and ensure that it can be safely reattached later on.
bpsb-intro-auto-building=In addition to God-mode, you have some Editor-mode capabilities as well! Normally, God-mode would place ghost-entities without the items in your inventory, but here, ghosts are automatically filled-in for you. Upgrade and Deconstruction Planners also take effect immediately.\n\nSince this cannot use the Editor-mode - thus must occur in Lua - this is unfortunately slower than Editor-mode's "immediately construct" settings. Also, to workaround some potential bugs concerning orders-of-operations, there are a few settings relating to these behaviors.\n\nCreating, Destroying, and Upgrading can each happen synchronously (on the same tick as the Event) or asynchronously (on a periodic tick scheduled after the Event). By default in Factorio < 1.1.61, to handle a bug concerning the Smart-Belts setting, only Creation is set to asynchronous.\n\nIn the Mod Settings, setting the Async-per-tick value to anything above zero will enable this behavior, controlling the amount handled for each Sandbox individually. When disabled, exactly when the Event is fired is also when that Request is handled. When enabled, the Requests are left-alone, instead scheduled to be handled on a future tick. The setting then controls how many of those Requests are handled each iteration; naturally, this is a performance setting - do you care for throughput or latency?\n\nLastly, manual deconstruction is also handled immediately by default. This is handled by an insanely large increase to the Sandbox's Mining Speed. This increase is adjustable in Mod Settings.
bpsb-intro-illusions=Complex Entities have the potential to cause many sorts of issues when used within Sandboxes; sometimes this or another mod would crash, an odd or irreversible gameplay issue would occur, or it simply would not be desired to have that Entity in the Sandbox.\n\nIllusions are the solution to this problem. When certain problematic Entities are placed in a Sandbox, they are replaced with an Illusion of that Entity. This "fake" Entity has the same size, graphics, and base functionality as the original, but it will not have any script-driven functionality. It's slightly more advanced than a cardboard cutout.\n\nIllusions are automatically translated for you. When you place the Entity in a Sandbox it's automatically converted to the Illusion; and when you create a blueprint the Illusions are automatically converted to their real counterparts. However, sometimes another mod might have already attempted to prevent you from placing the real Entity in the Sandbox; for this situation, you can try building a ghost instead with __ALT_CONTROL__1__build-ghost__, since that might not have been blocked.
bpsb-factorissimo-introduction=Compatibility with Factorissimo is possible as long as you are using notnotmelon's fork, since it introduces some APIs that make the integration possible.\n\nFor the most part, Factories placed inside of Sandboxes will gain the extra functionality provided by that Sandbox. For example, automated ghost-filling and quick-crafting both work inside of Factorissimo Factories. However, there are a few limitations that are unavoidable.\n\nSince Factories are stored in a shared-surface, some surface-wide functionality has been disabled inside of them. You cannot adjust the Brightness within Factories, and you cannot reset them either. Also, the "persistence" of your invisible-body would be overly complex to handle, so you cannot leave the Sandbox or transfer to another Sandbox if you are inside of a Factory within it - you must exit the Factory first.

[messages]
universe-of-sandboxes-intro=Welcome to the Universe of Sandboxes! Every Planet will be Lab Tiles, but otherwise has all its normal properties.\nUse the Editor to fundamentally change the landscape, if you need to. Exiting the Editor will swap to the lesser God-mode.\nWithout a Character, when you use the Remote View to see another Surface and then exit it, Factorio will place you on that Surface. Use this to interact more directly and without radar coverage restrictions.
blueprint-in-cursor-from-library=There was a Blueprint in your cursor, but Factorio incorrectly describes it as invalid. This is most likely because it's currently in the Blueprint Library (a known bug in Factorio).
blueprint-selected-new-contents-from-library=[img=utility/warning_icon] Known issues in Factorio prevent mods from seeing or updating Blueprints when using 'Select new contents'. This mod requires that ability to swap the Fake Illusions for their Real Entities in your Blueprints. If you are including any Fake Illusions in this Blueprint, they likely will NOT be replaced, especially if the source Blueprint is within the Library instead of your Inventory. This message will only appear periodically. See the mod's page for more details.
character-lost=[img=utility/warning_icon] Unfortunately, your previous Character was completely lost, so you must start anew.
choose-first-associated-character=[img=utility/warning_icon] You have multiple associated characters but the Sandbox does not know exactly which one you wanted, so it's choosing the first it can find
god-inventory-almost-full=[img=utility/warning_icon] Your inventory is almost full. Please throw some items away.
factorissimo-cannot-change-sandbox=[img=utility/warning_icon] You are inside of a factory building, so you cannot change Sandboxes.
sandbox-force-changed-while-in-sandbox=Your Force changed, so you have been removed from a Sandbox that you are no longer allowed in.
sandbox-entrace-from-unsupported-controller=[img=utility/warning_icon] You have entered a Sandbox in an odd way, and using an unsupported Controller. You are on your own.
sandbox-exiting-without-known-entrace=[img=utility/warning_icon] You must not have come into the Sandbox in an expected way, because it does not know where you came from. What happens next might be unexpected.
sandbox-unsafe-to-close-remote-view=You are using a remote view that cannot be safely closed, so you cannot enter a Sandbox. Return to your Character first.
