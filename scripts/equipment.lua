Before 1.1.87, there was a bug that did not correctly forcefully generate
chunks for surfaces with the Lab Tiles setting, which required us to
fix those tiles after generation but before placing the Blueprint.
This but was fixed in 1.1.87, however, it introduced another bug where
building a blueprint then did not immediately work on those tiles,
but building entities seemed to, since the forceful generation was not working.
In 2.0.24, this was finally fixed for real, but apparently the fog-of-war setting
is inverted, so it may break in the future if that API changes.
